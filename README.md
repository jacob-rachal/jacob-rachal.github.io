# My Portfolio Project
This repository is the Boilerplate for Jacob Rachal's Portfolio Project, for Geekwise's class "Mobile-Friendly Websites". It started life as a copied version of one of those websites that I worked on, but has undergone changes to make it what it is today.  Furthermore, it contains links to all the projects I have made since I started taking classes @ Geekwise, and maybe some stuff I made during my time at Fresno State.  If I get around to it.
